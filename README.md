Aleck is a bot which will basically convert any language translation query one can have.We are trying to implement it on english spanish and french language.
It will have extra features to convert speech to speech and image to text translation also.


In the respective project we are making a bot which helps larger audience to understand and read the news in a very efficient and easy way.As its name suggest ,our bot will able to provide solution in various languages. Aleck can categorize that what and where objects are present in the image ,summarize the bigger articles of news in to smaller paragraph and provide the information that whether the news is good or bad. Moreover it all happens in text to text form,image to text form and speech to speech form in different languages.
